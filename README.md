# webdriver_detector
This code could be used to determine whether any in-page test can detect a WebDriver-driven browser session. But presently such tests cannot detect WebDriver. Someday, though!

## Usage

Run the test: `npm test spec/appSpec.js`

## Context

[Can you detect WebDriver sessions from inside a web page?](https://hoosteeno.com/2018/01/23/can-you-detect-webdriver-sessions-from-inside-a-web-page/)
